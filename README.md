## Downloads & Setup

On first time usage, two folders `./db/` and `./settings/` with files inside of them will be created. Your settings and progress are stored there so it is advised not to delete or move those.  
New files with default settings will be created if this does end up happening.

### Windows

If you are on Windows you can download the latest release on the [releases tab](https://github.com/atomflunder/ring-fit-adventure-tracker/releases) and run the executable `rfa.exe`.

Of course you can also [install rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install), clone this repository and run the program yourself using `cargo`:

```
cargo build --release   # To build
cargo run --release     # To run
```

### Linux & Mac OS

On Linux or Mac OS you will need to compile this program yourself.  
First you need to install Rust:

```
$ curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.3 https://sh.rustup.rs -sSf | sh
```

Then clone this repository, and run the program yourself using `cargo`:

```
